            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

What is this, but to be▪paw our Reform'd Church, and make it stink in the Nostrels of every rational man? when such Brutes, such Animals as these, which are neither Priests nor Christians, are <hi>[Nemine Contradicente]</hi> admitted to be the Supporters and Pillars of the Church o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the year 1678. did this ugly Fiend appear in this Kingdom, (sent, no doubt, from Hall) to speak the <hi>Prologue</hi> to a most Horrid, Hellish Damnable, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Conspiracy.</hi> The <hi>Prologue,</hi> ('tis true) was an ugly frightful sound, a <hi>Popish Plot;</hi> but the bloody <hi>Tragedy</hi> which follow'd, proved a most inhuman direful Conspiracy indeed, too black for Hell, where certainly it was hatch'd, but here to be acted by the Sober Party: And the business to be done, was, the Destruction of your Sacred Majesty, the Protestant Religion, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and 'tis no wonder if it was <hi>to the amazement of your Majesty and your Privy-Councel</hi> since all the world who heard of it stood at gaze, and knew not what to say or think.</p>

            <p>The premisses consider'd, your Petitioner humbly prays, That the villainies of this impudent Fellow may farther be detected in some of your Majesties Courts of Judicature, and that he may have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In a word, to make reparation to my Honour, and Innocency, let us see this shameless Villain strip'd naked, and fast bound at the foot of the <hi>Monument,</hi> stigmatized with the infamous Characters of his life, <hi>viz. <hi>Infidelity, Atheism, Lying, Perjury, Blasphemy, Buggery, Treason, Pillage, Napine, Sacriledge, Murder, Impudence, Ignorance, no Christian, no Priest, no Doctor, no Saviour,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus, Dread Monarch, let us see this Monster exposed to the scorn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision of all the world, that he may be a terror to Posterity and future Ages; And your Petitioner (as in duty bound) shall ever pray for your Majesties Health, long Life, and happy Reign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
